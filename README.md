The Odin Project - Fundamentals: HTML Foundations (Project: Recipes)

I will create a simple website using skills I have learned so far from The Odin Project.  Though I do have prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I am completing this course as if I am learning from the beginning.  So, I will only use techniques I have learned from this lesson plan only (no advanced HTML or CSS).  This includes links, images, lists, headings, etc.
